    <p> In this<strong> article, you learned how to change the font/text size of an HTML element using CSS.</strong> You also saw how <q>developers did it before the introduction of HTML5.Also, keep in mind that it's always better to style</q> your HTML elements using internal or external styling, as it offers a lot of flexibility compared to inline styling. For example, you can make use of one CSS class for all your p tags rather than having to add inline styles to all your p tag elements.Using inline styles is not considered best practice because it results in a lot of repetition – you cannot reuse the styles elsewhere.
